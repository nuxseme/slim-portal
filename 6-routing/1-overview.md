# Routing

 

The Slim Framework’s router is built on top of the [Fast Route](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute) component, and it is remarkably fast and stable. While we are using this component to do all our routing, the app’s core has been entirely decoupled from it and interfaces have been put in place to pave the way for using other routing libraries.
